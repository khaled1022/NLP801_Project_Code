## Text Summarization Project
### Introduction
This repository contains code for a text summarization project that utilizes two main code files: ZeroShot.ipynb and FineTuning.ipynb. 
These notebooks are designed to perform various aspects of text summarization using pre-trained language models.

## Project Overview
Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer document while retaining its main ideas and key information.
This project aims to demonstrate two different approaches to text summarization: zero-shot summarization and fine-tuning-based summarization.

### Zero-Shot Summarization (ZeroShot.ipynb)
File: ZeroShot.ipynb
Description: This notebook implements a zero-shot text summarization technique. 
Zero-shot summarization does not require fine-tuning on specific data but instead utilizes pre-trained language models to generate summaries. 
It's a quick and efficient way to summarize text without the need for extensive training data.
### Fine-Tuning-Based Summarization (FineTuning.ipynb)
File: FineTuning.ipynb
Description: This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for text summarization. 
Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to specific summarization tasks by using domain-specific training data. 
It provides more control over the summarization process and can yield better results for specific use cases.
